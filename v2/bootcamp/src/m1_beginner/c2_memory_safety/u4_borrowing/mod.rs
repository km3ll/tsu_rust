     * Borrowing
     * - the act of creating a reference
     * - references are pointers with rules/restrictions
     * - references do not take ownership
     * 
     * Why borrow?
     * - performance
     * - when ownership is not needed/desired
     * 
     * Rules
     * - at any given time, you can have either one mutable reference
     *   or any number of immutable references
     * - references must always be valid
